Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x

Steps to follow in setting integration test.

 1. Download ESB 5.0.0-SNAPSHOT from official website. Extract the ESB and put "-XX:-UseSplitVerifier" under $JVM_MEM_OPTS into {ESB_HOME}/bin/wso2server.sh.

 2. Navigate to "https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download/" URL and download Confluence. Use the below URL to setup Confluence.
      https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-installation-guide-135681.html
      
 3. If required add the X.509 certificate from "https://confluence.atlassian.com" to the client-truststore.jks of the ESB located in "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security" directory by using the command 'keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "CERT_NAME"'
    and wso2carbon.jks located in "<CONFLUENCE_CONNECTOR_HOME>/confluence-connector/confluence-connector-2.0.0/org.wso2.carbon.connector/src/test/resources/keystores/products" by using the command 'keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "CERT_NAME"'.

      This command will import Confluence certificate into keystore.
               To import the certificate give "wso2carbon" as password. Press "Y" to complete certificate import process.
